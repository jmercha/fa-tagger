# fa-tagger

Tagging app for Font Awesome glpyh icons, implemented with React, Redux, TypeScript

## What?

It's a simple web app that lets you associate tags with FontAwesome glyph icons, filter & search them.

It's useful if you have a project with extensive use of Glyphicons, with icons associated to specific domain concepts. 

Having a central thing to tag them all would be quite handy!

The tags are all stored in your browser's local storage.

## Why?

I wanted to improve my understanding of Redux application structure & data flow.

I originally created V1 as an example project for a talk I gave on Aurelia at an Adelaide Frontend JS meetup, but given there is a stronger market for React frontend developers I decided to implement V2 in React/Redux.
